## Predictive Insights for Reducing Customer Churn

## Project Overview<a name="project-overview"></a>
This a strategic initiative undertaken by SyriaTel, a prominent telecommunications company, to tackle the challenge of customer attrition. The main objective of this initiative is to uncover the intricate web of factors that contribute to customer churn and predict which subscribers are likely to discontinue their services. Armed with a wealth of customer data, ranging from demographics and subscription details to usage patterns and support interactions, SyriaTel is on a quest to unlock predictive insights. The ultimate goal is to empower SyriaTel with the ability to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and optimize their service offerings, thereby reducing revenue loss and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

## Business Problem<a name="business-problem"></a>
### Stakeholder: SyriaTel Company
In a competitive telecom market, SyriaTel faces a critical business problem which is escalating customer churn rates, driven by undisclosed customer dissatisfaction and suboptimal service experiences. With an ever-expanding array of services and plans, the company is challenged to understand and predict why certain subscribers decide to leave. This surge in customer attrition not only impacts SyriaTel's revenue but also casts a shadow over its reputation. The business problem at hand is to proactively identify those customers at risk of churning by decoding the intricate blend of demographic, usage, and interaction data. SyriaTel aims to transform this challenge into an opportunity by deploying predictive insights to enhance customer retention, thereby securing a competitive edge in the telecommunications industry.

## Data Understanding<a name="data-understanding"></a>
The dataset for the SyriaTel customer retention project comprises an array of features that offer insight into customer behavior and its impact on churn. These features include geographic indicators like state and area code, historical account length, communication preferences such as voicemail messages, and usage patterns during different times of the day (day and evening minutes, calls, and charges). International and nighttime usage metrics are also recorded, along with customer service interactions and the crucial 'Churn' variable, which signifies customer disengagement. By delving into this dataset, SyriaTel aims to uncover predictive insights that will enable them to proactively address churn and enhance customer retention, ultimately strengthening their position in the telecommunications industry.


## Modeling<a name="modeling"></a>
I employed several machine learning models for modeling the telecom churn prediction project. These models include logistic regression, which is effective for binary classification tasks, and decision tree classifiers, which offer interpretability and insights into feature importance. Both models have been assessed and evaluated using various metrics to gauge their performance on both the training and testing data. The logistic regression model demonstrated moderate discriminatory power, while the decision tree model showed strengths in overall correctness but offered opportunities for improvement in precision, recall, and their balance. Further refinements and exploration of other models were considered to achieve the project's goals.
