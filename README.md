### Stakeholder: SyriaTel Company
In a competitive telecom market, SyriaTel faces a critical business problem which is escalating customer churn rates, driven by undisclosed customer dissatisfaction and suboptimal service experiences. With an ever-expanding array of services and plans, the company is challenged to understand and predict why certain subscribers decide to leave.
